Visulus - The Visual Calculator

Visulus is a tool like no other in the educational field. It uses animation to help students visualize mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, Visulus does not simply play animations of static calculations--instead, it dynamically Visulates any problem it is able to solve.

We believe that there is no other tool like Visulus on the Internet. We encourage you to use it for any reason: to help teach mathematical methods, to learn arithmetic operations, or to refresh your knowledge of basic calculations.

Visulus was created by Commented Out, a team consisting of Nathanial Pawelczyk and Nicholas Ward, for the WebChallenge competition hosted by the Technology Association of Georgia's Education Collaborative.
