Visulus - The Visual Calculator

Visulus is a tool like no other in the educational field. It uses animation to help students visualize mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, Visulus does not simply play animations of static calculations--instead, it dynamically Visulates any problem it is able to solve.

We believe that there is no other tool like Visulus on the Internet. We encourage you to use it for any reason: to help teach mathematical methods, to learn arithmetic operations, or to refresh your knowledge of basic calculations.

Thank you for using Visulus. If there is anything you would like to let us know, please contact us by using the link on the navigation bar.

We recommend using the latest version of Firefox, Safari, or Chrome with this website.
